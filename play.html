<p> <h5>QUIRKE.</h5> There must be great bulk in them indeed.</p>

<p> <h5>MRS DELANE.</h5> It is no wonder he to get the job. He must have a great character, so many persons to write for him as what there did. </p>

<p> <h5>HYACINTH.</h5> I see no living thing but that thrush——  </p>

<p><h5>ANDREW.</h5> I know, I know.</p>

<p><h5>ELLEN.</h5> What! You're really decided——</p>

<p><h5>JOEL.</h5> <p>[Approaching.]</p> Hello, Sis!</p>

<p><h5>ELLEN.</h5> <p>[Absently.]</p> Ah, Joel; that you? <p>[Eagerly, following Andrew to the knapsack.]</p> But, my dear——</p>

<p><h5>ANDREW.</h5> Just these few things, and we're off.</p>

<p><h5>MISS JOYCE.</h5> <p>[Picking it up.]</p> A half-a-crown! Where, now, did you get that much, Fardy?</p>

<p><h5>FARDY.</h5> Where did I get it, is it?</p>

<p><h5>MISS JOYCE.</h5> I'll engage it was in no honest way you got it.</p>

<p><h5>FARDY.</h5> I picked it up in the street——</p>

<p><h5>MISS JOYCE.</h5> If you did, why didn't you bring it to the sergeant or to his reverence?</p>

<p><h5>MRS. DELANE.</h5> And some poor person, maybe, being at the loss of it.</p>
