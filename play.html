MR. QUIRKE. There must be great bulk in them indeed.<br>

MRS. DELANE. It is no wonder he to get the job. He must have a great character, so many persons to write for him as what there did. <br>

HYACINTH. I see no living thing but that thrush——  <br>

ANDREW. I know, I know.<br>

ELLEN. What! You're really decided——<br>

JOEL. [Approaching.] Hello, Sis!<br>

ELLEN. [Absently.] Ah, Joel; that you? [Eagerly, following Andrew to the knapsack.] But, my dear——<br>

ANDREW. Just these few things, and we're off.<br>

MISS JOYCE. [Picking it up.] A half-a-crown! Where, now, did you get that much, Fardy?<br>

FARDY. Where did I get it, is it?<br>

MISS JOYCE. I'll engage it was in no honest way you got it.<br>

FARDY. I picked it up in the street——<br>

MISS JOYCE. If you did, why didn't you bring it to the sergeant or to his reverence?<br>

MRS. DELANE. And some poor person, maybe, being at the loss of it.<br>
